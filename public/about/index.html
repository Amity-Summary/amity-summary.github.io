<h1>About</h1>

<content>
  <p>When you want to see if an amity combination is available you either have to filter
trough all the different spreadsheets or to keep checking the summaries for the
different parties. Those solutions can be very overwhelming at first, and
neither or those are very accessible, so here&rsquo;s my solution to it.</p>
<h2 id="general-summary">General Summary</h2>
<p>This summary contains all the amities where at least the first two ones are max rolls (the
maximum bonus available). There are some exceptions for astoundingly good amities and for
bonuses that are great at lower rolls.</p>
<h2 id="extended-summary">Extended Summary</h2>
<p>This summary contains all the amities with at least two <em>good</em> rolls,
regardless of their position. Rolls can lower than max rolls to some extent.</p>
<h2 id="beginner-summaries-crit-and-accessory">Beginner Summaries (Crit and Accessory)</h2>
<p>Those summaries are tailored for new players, as such they will contain, all instances where
the related bonus is present in the first slot (common+), regardless of the other rolls. All
the other bonuses of a given amity will be displayed as well.</p>
