  <h2 id="what-is-this">What is this?</h2>
<p>For information about the summaries and their purpose, please refer to the
<a href="/about/">About</a> page.</p>
<h2 id="how-often-is-this-updated">How often is this updated?</h2>
<p>For now the updates are manual, i&rsquo;ll do my best to keep the data
up to date, but please keep in mind that this is a way to check
if an amity combination is available in a public party, and it&rsquo;s
<strong>not</strong> a replacement for weekly summaries in the respective servers.</p>
<h2 id="i-see-that-a-bonus-available-this-week-is-missing-from-the-summaries">I see that a bonus available this week is missing from the summaries!</h2>
<p>Please refer to the previous question. If you find any missing data,
feel free to open an issue or contact me directly on discord.</p>
<h2 id="i-see-a-bonus-im-looking-for-is-not-present-in-the-summaries-does-that-mean-its-not-available-anywhere">I see a bonus i&rsquo;m looking for is not present in the summaries, does that mean it&rsquo;s not available anywhere?</h2>
<p>Not necessarily, some bonuses are excluded since they&rsquo;re not very
desireable by many players.
Furthermore, all the gathered data comes from the community effort of the
hunters that put in time and effort to map the amities available each week (as
well as the owner and the hoster of the bot we use for tracking), so consider
contributing and maybe something good will come up!</p>
<h2 id="what-does-the-s-means">What does the (S) means?</h2>
<p>It means that it&rsquo;s a simplified sheet for new players. Please refer to
the <a href="/about/">About</a> page for more information.</p>
